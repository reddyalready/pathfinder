# Pathfinder

*Pathfinder was one of my assignments at University. It's super old and I found it on the new gone Google Code. I hope someone can find this helpful while wading through routing algorithms on the internet, but it may be work getting it to work*

PathFinder is a free, demonstrative swing based program that uses the A* algorithm to attempt to find the shortest path between two points.

## Features
- Custom maze size selection
- Intuitive GUI
- Optimized A* algorithm
- Simulated seeking

## Helpful Links
Here are some links I found especially useful when learning about pathfinding and the A* algorithm:
