# Pathfinder

Pathfinder is a free, demonstrative Javascript program that finds paths in generated mazes using the A-Star pathfinding algorithm.

This is currently a work in progress.

## Developer Guide

### Building

Use `npm run build` to create the dist folder and pull in dependencies.

### Running

Run `npm run dev` to start the development server. The app will be available at http://localhost:8080.
